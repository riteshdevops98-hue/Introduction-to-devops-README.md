📘 Absolute Prerequisite for Learning DevOps 
1. Context

Many people learn DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, etc.) but struggle to understand where DevOps fits in real organizations.

As a DevOps engineer:

You do not directly interact with customers.

You get requirements indirectly → passed down through multiple roles in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

2. Example Setup (Case Study)

Company: Amazon.

Project: Amazon Fresh (grocery delivery).

Scenario: You are hired as a DevOps Engineer for Amazon Fresh.

3. Flow of Requirements (Top to Bottom)
(1) Customers

The ultimate source of requirements.

Give feedback (positive or negative).

Example:

“Deliver groceries in 15 minutes.”

“Add UPI / Stripe payment gateway.”

(2) Business Analyst (BA)

Role: Connects business + customers + product team.

Collects requirements from customers/market.

Creates BRD (Business Requirement Document).

Example: Writes BRD for “15-min delivery service”.

(3) Product Manager (PM)

Role: Sets vision & priorities for product.

Decides what to implement first.

Example: Chooses to implement 15-min delivery in Q1 instead of payment gateway.

(4) Product Owner (PO)

More technical + tactical than PM.

Breaks PM’s vision into Epics / Features / Actionable items.

Example: For “15-min delivery”:

New UI for delivery slot.

Backend changes for route optimization.

Database setup for pin codes.

(5) Solution Architect (SA)

Deep technical expertise.

Designs HLD (High-Level Design) and LLD (Low-Level Design).

Validates feasibility.

Example: Confirms infra, frameworks, DB design.

(6) Development Team (Devs)

Get HLD/LLD from architect.

Analyze requirements → may need infra support.

Example: Request from DevOps team:

Kubernetes cluster.

Dockerfiles.

Git repositories.

(7) DevOps Engineers

Provide infra, automation, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, deployments.

Work closely with developers + QA + DB admins.

Do not invent features, but enable developers to deliver.

(8) QA Engineers

Test the features, run automation, ensure quality.

(9) Database Admins (DBA)

Handle DB setup & administration.

Sometimes setup is done by DevOps, but management is DBA’s role.

(10) SRE (Site Reliability Engineers)

Post-deployment → ensure reliability, availability, monitoring, alerting.

(11) Technical Writers

Document features, APIs, and updates.

Ensure external/internal users can understand the product.

4. Scrum Team Composition

A Scrum Team usually includes:

Developers

DevOps Engineers

QA Engineers

DB Admins

Sometimes Tech Writers

👉 They work together to complete requirements.

5. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Phases:

Planning → Requirements collected (BA).

Analysis → Feasibility & prioritization (PM).

Design → HLD/LLD by Architects.

Implementation → Devs + DevOps + QA build it.

Testing & Integration → QA validates.

Maintenance → SRE ensures reliability.

⚡ SDLC looks simple in diagrams, but in reality involves many roles & iterations.

6. Tooling Example – Jira

Widely used project management tool.

Tasks flow into Jira:

BA / PM / PO → Create Epics, Stories, Tasks.

Developers & DevOps → Pick tasks, update progress.

PM → Track completion status.

 Customers
     ↓
 Business Analyst (BA) → Creates BRD
     ↓
 Product Manager (PM) → Prioritizes
     ↓
 Product Owner (PO) → Breaks into Epics/Stories
     ↓
 Solution Architect (SA) → HLD + LLD
     ↓
 Developers → Need Infra/CI/CD
     ↓
 DevOps Engineers → Provide Infra, Pipelines, Automation
     ↓
 QA Engineers → Test features
     ↓
 DB Admins → Database setup & management
     ↓
 SREs → Monitoring, Reliability
     ↓
 Technical Writers → Documentation

8. Key Takeaways for DevOps Engineer

You don’t directly get requirements → you support developers.

Your tasks come via Dev → PO → SA → PM → BA → Customers chain.

Typical responsibilities:

Provision infra (Kubernetes, Docker, AWS resources).

Automate builds & deployments (CI/CD pipelines).

Maintain repos, environments (Dev, QA, Prod).

Support QA with test automation infra.

Collaborate with DBAs, SREs.
